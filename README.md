# Medical_Analytics
A data-driven healthcare revenue analytics project built using Python, Pandas, and Tableau. It models patient payment behavior, visualizes claim denials, payer efficiency, and financial KPIs, and uses ML to predict likelihood-to-pay bridging financial insight with operational intelligence.


🏥 Healthcare Revenue Analytics & Patient Payment Prediction

This project analyzes healthcare revenue cycle performance using Python, Pandas, and Tableau, blending financial KPIs, payer efficiency metrics, and predictive modeling to uncover how hospitals can improve collections, reduce denials, and better understand patient payment behavior.


📊 Project Overview

The dashboard and models offer a full 360° view of the healthcare revenue process - from billing and collections to denials and write-offs.
Key objectives:

Track financial KPIs like Collection Rate, Write-off %, and Cost-to-Collect.

Evaluate payer performance and denial root causes.

Analyze geographic and patient-level patterns in payment behavior.

Build ML models to predict likelihood to pay and financial assistance eligibility.
